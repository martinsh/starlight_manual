- **Refined controls for stars**. Stars amount, scale and seed can now be controlled to get more unique results.


`fixed:`{: .label-fixed }

- Fixed issue when **animating sun** via horizontal and vertical rotation or Sun Position add-on did cause sun to stutter. **Important Note**: in order for old projects to work with PSA v1.6 - disable and re-enable checkbox in the panel.

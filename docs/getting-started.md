# Getting started

_Physical Starlight and Atmosphere_ (PSA)  is a Blender add-on for advanced environmental lighting that provides high quality atmospherics
and lighting, and visual consistency between every object in your scene. It can be installed as any other Blender add-on.

## Requirements

Latest _Physical Starlight and Atmosphere_ version is supported by [Blender 3.4+](https://www.blender.org/).
The add-on versions between v1.2 and v1.6.1 still work on [Blender 2.81 - 3.3](https://www.blender.org/).

## Installation

- To then remove the _Atmosphere_, you can locate and click the `X Remove Atmosphere` button.

[![Disable PSA](img/DISABLE_PSA.jpg)](img/DISABLE_PSA.jpg)

!!! summary "What happens when the atmosphere is added?"
    - A couple of shader nodes are imported and dynamically added and connected to the currently active world. When you remove the _Atmosphere_, these nodes will subsequently be removed.
    - The Sun lamp `Starlight Sun` is added. The Sun lamp is used as the main light source to cast shadows from the Sun. When you remove the _Atmosphere_, if no active PSA instances are found in other worlds context's, it will be removed.


## Preferences
There is no one _right way_ way to use this add-on. That is why we encourage you to find the way
it works best for you. 

The add-on [preferences panel](img/UI/UI_preferences.jpg) is located under
`Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`.

### Toolbar Enabled
:octicons-milestone-24: _Default_: `true`

By default, the _Atmosphere_ tab is in the sidebar of Blender 3D viewport (`N` key) and "World Properties" tab in
Properties panel. Setting this to `false` will hide the toolbar. Reveal panel by clicking on _Atmosphere_ tab. 

### Toolbar Label
:octicons-milestone-24: _Default_: `"Atmosphere"`

By default, Toolbar tab for _Physical Starlight and Atmosphere_ is _Atmosphere_. It might be useful to rename it
to something shorter like `PSA` to reduce space the tab is taking. 

### Use ACES color space
:octicons-milestone-24: _Default_: `false`

The Academy Color Encoding System[^1] (ACES) is a color image encoding system created by hundreds of industry professionals. ACES allows for a fully encompassing color accurate workflow, with seamless interchange of high quality motion picture images regardless of source.


### Use real world physical values
:octicons-milestone-24: _Default_: `false`

By default, add-on reduces `atmosphere`, `sun` and `stars` intensity values to get the feeling _it just works_, and you 
don't have to modify extra parameter `Exposure` in order to get realistic atmosphere. But very important part of this 
add-on is having real world physical values to support visual consistency.

<!-- ### Experimental Features
:octicons-milestone-24: _Default_: `false`

Enables features that may not be fully functional and tested for all cases. Current list of experimental features:

* [Binary Sun](/psa/binary-sun/) -->

## Presets

Presets allow you to store a snapshot of your customized atmosphere settings and return to it later or use already predefined presets provided by the add-on.

[![Preset panel](img/PRESET_PANEL.jpg)](img/PRESET_PANEL.jpg)

The add-on comes with 10 different presets:

- `earth`
- `earth 2`
- `earth 3`
- `hazy summer`
- `mars`
- `nishita`
- `retrowave`
- `tatooine`
- `thick fog`
- `thick haze`
  
### How to use presets

1. Install the PSA add-on (version 1.8+).
2. Enable the add-on inside the *Blender Preferences*.
3. Add the *Atmosphere* inside the *Blender Viewport*, which will make the presets visible inside the add-ons _N Panel_.
4. In the _N Panel_ under `Presets` tab pick a preset of your liking.
5. You should now see the preset in your scene!

??? summary "Troubleshooting: Concerning previous versions of Presets"     
    If you have used the previous versions of Presets (using the asset browser) this is how you can migrate them to the new system:
                
      - Navigate to Blender asset libraries
      - There you have to find the User Library ''PSA'' or the library's name that corresponds to your presets
      - drag the asset in to your scene
      - create a new preset through the n panel, name and save it
      - you now have your preset migrated!
        

### How to make your own presets

1. In the `PSA` _N Panel_ click `+ Create New`.
2. Name it something memorable, avoid special characters.
3. Modify the `PSA` parameters to your liking.
4. Save the changes you made!

!!! tip 
    Use ''Use preset sun location'' if you want to save the suns location in the preset. If you don't want the preset to change your suns location, then leave the box unchecked.
